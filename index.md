Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, co-advised by [krste asanović](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) and [sophia shao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ysshao/) . I'm interested in warehouse-scale computing and developing tools for computer architecture research. I'm currently working on the [FireSim](https://fires.im/) project.
